# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a student learning programming, and cybersecurity.
<br/>
on my free time I code silly projects, or fun projects, but i like to code things that i enjoy.
<br/>
I love to play a unique game called [Grey Hack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/).
<br/>
I mainly code in `Python`.
<br/>
I love to code stupid games, fun projects and important real life tools.
<br/>
Thats it i guess, dont wanna flood this readme lol
